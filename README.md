The Peripheral Nerve Bypass Nanotechnology for Neuroprosthetic Applications (PN Relay) project started in 2019. This initiative comes as a result of a partnership between Politecnico di Milano and Politecnico di Torino and has as a main objective the creation of a fully implantable device that can act as a neural interface capable to strengthen or restore completely the lost fundamental function of the nervous system after a peripheral nerve injury. The design idea consists in registering the neural signal information in an area upstream the injured nerve portion and selectively converting it into the correct stimulus to deliver to the downstream portion, eliciting the desired motor or sensory impulse. The device requirement consists in having the possibility of wireless bidirectional communication of data, while keeping the overall device compact, biocompatible and suitable even for chronic implantation. For experimental purposes at first the device will be applied and tested on healthy patients, then it will be moved onto patients affected by a condition referred to as axonotmesis, characterized by partial axonal degeneration. In this final case of application, the aim will be leveraging on the residual nerve signal coming from the fibres of the nerve that were not affected by the damaging mechanical constriction.

Project description

PNRelay aims to develop a fully implanted neural bypass device to restore motor and sensorial function in limbs, addressing peripheral nerve injuries impacting about 50 ppm worldwide. These injuries lead to a decline in quality of life due to disrupted brain-body communication, with traditional techniques often failing to restore function effectively. Nerve injuries can have a spontaneous regeneration, however in only 40% of cases present a satisfying recovery. All others subject needs extensive treatments and increasing healthcare costs. Our technology addresses these problems by focusing on peripheral nerves to reduce system complexity. Our preliminary device for preclinical trials records sensory signals downstream of the injury, classifies them, and stimulates nerves to generate motor signals, bypassing the lesion. It features a single strip of rigid-flex PCB with sensing electrodes and biocompatible silicone encapsulation, utilizing wireless data transfer and power. This innovative approach could improve quality of life by 80%. With a global market of 2 million people affected by nerve pathologies, valued at $60 billion every 10 years. By addressing the challenges of peripheral nerve injuries with cutting-edge technology, PNRelay aims to revolutionize neurorehabilitation and improve patient outcomes.

Competitive Scenario

In the current landscape of peripheral nerve repair solutions, esteemed competitors such as Stimwave, Nalu Medical, Inbrain neuroelectronics, Neuralink and researchers from Feinstein Institutes and Ohio State University, while highly qualified, do not focus on the specific application we propose. Their strategies encompass drug delivery, regenerative medicine, or implanted devices, targeting the central nervous systemâ€™s complexity. Our approach mitigates model complexity by concentrating on the nerve of interest, facilitating more intuitive signal analysis. This is particularly effective as brain signal responses remain insufficiently understood, complicating their analysis, whereas peripheral nerve signals are more comprehensible. The prevailing deficiencies among competitors are twofold: first, implanted device signal analysis is inconsistent. Our solution addresses this issue by ensuring more precise signal analysis. Second, traditional medical treatments can only benefit a limited percentage of patients. Conversely, our device has the potential to treat all patients, guaranteeing an 80% functional recovery. Our technology, focusing on direct neural bypass for peripheral nerves like the sciatic nerve, employs targeted electrical stimulation to offer a comprehensive solution that surpasses existing methods. This approach optimizes motor function restoration, significantly enhancing outcomes compared to current technologies.

BUSINESS MODEL

Our innovative technology targets hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and private clinics, promising an 80% improvement in quality of life by effectively bypassing nerve lesions, reducing the need for extensive treatments, and lowering healthcare costs. We aim to generate revenue through device sales, service contracts, and licensing agreements with healthcare providers. Our go-to-market strategy includes direct sales, partnerships with medical device distributors, and collaborations for clinical trials. We aim to maintain strong customer relationships through ongoing support and training, along with regular updates and improvements based on feedback. Our key activities involve rigorous preclinical and clinical trials, continuous product development, and securing regulatory approvals. PNRelay aims to revolutionize neurorehabilitation, delivering significant value to patients and healthcare systems alike.

Technology description

Our project leverages cutting-edge technologies to develop a sophisticated microelectronic device, integrating multiple advanced applications. Increased investment will enable us to revolutionize future medicine with these devices. Key technologies include the miniaturization of the implantable device, featuring reduced electronic components, low energy consumption, and high data processing capacity. The device is powered wirelessly, ensuring seamless operation. For data analysis, we use bioinformatics approaches with low-parameter classifiers, ensuring rapid and efficient data classification. The device is encapsulated in biocompatible silicone, enhancing patient comfort with improved geometry and materials, making it suitable for chronic applications. Additionally, our neuromodulation technology targets specific nerve fibers efficiently, restoring sensitivity or motor intent, and creating an effective neural bypass. These integrated technologies promise significant advancements in medical treatments and patient outcomes, positioning our project at the forefront of medical innovation.

Technology Roadmap

The next steps involve preclinical trials on animal models to test and validate the device. This includes refining the prototype, integrating wireless power transfer, and enhancing deep learning algorithms for the classification of the signals. Following successful preclinical trials, we will navigate regulatory pathways to obtain approvals for human trials, starting with Phase I (safety) and progressing through Phase III (efficacy). Once regulatory approvals are secured, we will set up pilot manufacturing, establish quality control processes, and scale up production. Market entry involves developing a comprehensive marketing strategy, establishing distribution channels, and launching the product to hospitals and healthcare facilities. Post-market surveillance will ensure device performance and user feedback for continuous improvement. Continual product enhancement will focus on customer support, feedback mechanisms, and ongoing R&D investment to explore new applications and technologies, ensuring long-term success and market adaptation.
